README Trabalho 2 INF1407: Site Web, frontend e backend separados Louis POTTIER / 2411430

The website is a running event website. It allows the organizers to add the runners' information to the table, including their number, name, last name, distance and duration.

They can do it only after having logged in. In case they want to change their password, knowing the actual one, they can do it. If they don't remember their password, all they have to do is type their email address, take the safety string received by email, enter it in the new page, and insert the new password.
